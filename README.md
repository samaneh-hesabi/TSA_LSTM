<div style="font-size:2.5em; font-weight:bold; text-align:center; margin-top:20px;">S&P 500 Time Series Prediction with LSTM</div>

This project demonstrates how to predict S&P 500 stock prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The code is kept simple and well-documented to help beginners understand the process.

# 1. Project Overview

## 1.1 What is Time Series Prediction?
Time series prediction is about using past values to predict future values. In this project, we use past S&P 500 prices to predict future prices.

## 1.2 What is LSTM?
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a type of neural network that's good at learning patterns in sequences of data. Think of it as a smart system that can remember important patterns from the past to make predictions about the future.

# 3. Code Components

## 3.1 Data Processing (`src/data/preprocess.py`)
- Loads and preprocesses S&P 500 data
- Handles date formatting
- Scales price data between 0 and 1
- Creates sequences for LSTM training
- Splits data into training and testing sets

## 3.2 LSTM Model (`src/models/lstm_model.py`)
- Implements a simple LSTM architecture
- Uses TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning
- Contains functions for:
  - Model creation
  - Training
  - Making predictions

## 3.3 Training Script (`src/models/train.py`)
- Main script that ties everything together
- Loads and prepares data
- Creates and trains the model
- Makes predictions and visualizes results

# 4. How to Use This Project

## 4.1 Setup
1. Make sure you have Python 3.8 or newer installed
2. Clone this repository
3. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
# On Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

4. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 4.2 Running the Code
From the project root directory:
```bash
python src/models/train.py
```

The script will:
1. Load the S&P 500 data
2. Train the LSTM model
3. Show a plot comparing actual vs predicted prices

## 4.3 Data Format
The project expects a CSV file with these columns:
- `date`: Date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- `price`: S&P 500 price value

# 5. Model Parameters

Key parameters you can adjust in the code:
- `sequence_length`: Number of past days to use (default: 10)
- `train_size`: Proportion of data for training (default: 0.8)
- `epochs`: Number of training iterations (default: 30)

# 6. Dependencies

Main packages required:
- tensorflow: Deep learning framework
- pandas: Data manipulation
- numpy: Numerical computations
- scikit-learn: Data preprocessing
- matplotlib: Plotting

Full list in `requirements.txt`

# 7. Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

## 7.1 Import Errors
If you see "No module named..." errors:
- Make sure you're in the project root directory
- Verify that all requirements are installed
- Check that your virtual environment is activated

## 7.2 TensorFlow Warnings
You might see warnings about:
- CPU instructions
- CUDA/GPU availability
These are normal and won't affect functionality.
